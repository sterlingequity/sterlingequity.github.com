				3. A <strong>strong management team and board</strong> with a track record of paying dividends and/or successfully deploying capital. 
				Management must be trustworthy, competent and motivated to create shareholder wealth.

			<p class="BodyText">
				4. <strong>Relatively predictable earnings and an ability to at least maintain profits in most economic environments.</strong> 
				We prefer businesses with little exposure to commodity prices, economic cycles and exchange rates.

				5. <strong>Conservatively geared</strong>.
